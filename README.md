# Rayster
Game Creation System (WIP, early alpha)

Rayster is a game creation system in the same spirit of ZZT or Megazeux, but it aims to include more advanced features without becoming a complicated or bloated concept at its heart. Based on a core engine written in C++ with modern OpenGL support, it exposes a Lua API for the game development part. Support for other scripting languages could be added via a plugin system. Such plugin system could be also extended even to make other plugable components.

The repository setup as the software itself are both work in progress at this moment.
